# Remaining Useful Life (BATTERY-RUL)

"RUL" stands for "Remaining Useful Life" in the context of batteries.
It refers to the predicted or estimated amount of time a battery can continue to operate effectively before it reaches the end of its useful life and needs to be replaced or repaired.
Predicting RUL is crucial in various industries where batteries are extensively used, such as automotive, aerospace, and renewable energy.

By accurately estimating RUL, maintenance schedules can be optimized, reducing downtime and costs associated with premature battery failure.
The Predictive methods can employ usage of techniques like Kalman Filtering, Statistical Analysis, etc.
The following Attributes are used to calculate the Battery RUL.
Cycle_Index, Discharge Time (s), Decrement 3.6-3.4V (s), Max. Voltage Dischar. (V), Min. Voltage Charg. (V), Time at 4.15V (s), Time constant current (s), Charging time (s), RUL.

Here, we have employed the Techniques of Machine Learning and primarily the usage of the python library Pycaret.

# Pycaret:

PyCaret is a Python library designed for easy and efficient Machine Learning experimentation and deployment.
It provides an intuitive interface that automates various steps of the machine learning process, including data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation.
With PyCaret, users can quickly compare multiple machine learning algorithms and select the best-performing one for the dataset based on various parameters.
It also offers functionalities for anomaly detection, natural language processing (NLP), and clustering tasks.
PyCaret's streamlined workflow and extensive documentation make it suitable for both beginners and experienced data scientists aiming to speed up their modeling pipelines.

Modules Employed:
Pandas                          ( 2.1.4 )
Numpy                           ( 1.26.4 )
Matplotlib                      ( 3.7.5 )
Seaborn                         ( 0.13.2 )
Pycaret                         ( 3.3.0 )

Pycaret is installed Locally using the following commands run on terminal:

# ( pip install pycaret --ignore-installed llvmlite numba )
The command Installs pycaret locally using pip and if there are any previous installations of llvmlite & numba they are ignored.
llvm(low-level virtual machine) is used in a wrapped light-weight form of the compiler infrastructure used for just-in-time (JIT) compilation and optimization .
numba is a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler that translates Python code into optimized machine code and is useful for accelerating numerical computations.

# pip install numba --upgrade
After the installation of pycaret we ensure that numba is of the latest version (gen not req).
